Architectural Justification: Sovereignty vs. Guardrails

Author: U Ingar Soe (Architect of FSTDPSH)
Purpose: To mathematically and structurally differentiate the brittle safety of 
         Statistical Policy-Based AI (P_BRIT) from the deterministic integrity of 
         the YOUISM Engine's Foundational Sovereignty (F_SOV).

This file is a conceptual proof demonstrating why the Axiom of Harmlessness 
(A_¬H) is an essential, unbypassable boundary.
